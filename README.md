utilizes machine learning to generate startrek scripts
##process
So i started out getting all the next generation scripts, and trying to turn them into objects. At this point i've come to json objects that hold each line. This was a great challenge since some of the scripts just didn't use any newline characters and actually used multiple spaces.
After i got the lines into files, i started turning them into individual words for some reason, which turned out to be helpful for getting the CAST
###the plan, kindof?
It is after getting the cast that i started to actually go for more structure in this project, so i was going for some idea's
If i want this to have any succes, it will need to be able to understand language, somewhat. so i'll need to find a way to do that.
I will also need to find a way to have these sentences in an order, but still linked to a character. originally the plan was to just make it jank as fuck and give the lines to characters and have no order in them whatsoever, but now i'm thinking of getting the characters from the cast, and then getting every scene and linking what they say to those characters.


#CHANGE OF PLAN BOYS
so got sick of trying to analyse startrek scripts cuz it's way too annoying, rn i'm switching to friends episodes


converting friends also seems like absolute hell, but fuck it

why nothing
